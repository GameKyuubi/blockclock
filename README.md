This requires a running bitcoin core node.  Should work on other nodes if
they use the same RPC calls.

Create a `config.json` file in the same directory as specified below:

{ "username": "RPC_USERNAME_HERE", "password": "RPC_PASSWORD_HERE" }

Rpc username and password must match bitcoin node config, obviously.
